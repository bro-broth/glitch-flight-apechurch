# Ape Church Game SDK — SKILL.md

This file contains instructions for AI agents building games using the Ape Church game template. Read this file in full before writing any code or modifying any files.

---

## 1. Files You May Edit

Only touch files in these locations:

```
components/my-game/          ← all game components go here
public/my-game/              ← all game assets go here
metadata.json                ← fill out before submitting
```

Rename `my-game` to your game's name in kebab-case throughout (e.g. `chicken-crossing`, `slot-machine`). This rename must be consistent across `components/`, `public/`, and `metadata.json`.

---

## 2. Files You Must Never Edit

Do not modify any of the following:

```
app/page.tsx
app/globals.css
app/layout.tsx
components/shared/           ← all files and subfolders
public/shared/               ← all files and subfolders
next.config.ts
tsconfig.json
package.json
package-lock.json
postcss.config.mjs
eslint.config.mjs
components.json
```

These are platform-managed files. Editing them will cause integration failures.

---

## 3. Required Component Files

Your `components/my-game/` folder must contain at minimum:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MyGame.tsx` | Root game component. Owns all state and exposes all lifecycle functions. |
| `MyGameWindow.tsx` | Game window wrapper. Child of `GameWindow` from shared. |
| `MyGameSetupCard.tsx` | Bet configuration UI shown in setup view. |

Optional files you may add:
- `myGameConfig.ts` — configuration constants (multipliers, speeds, thresholds, layout mode, etc.)
- `my-game.styles.css` — game-scoped styles
- `MyGameInGameOverlay.tsx` — in-game control bar for full-size layout (see § Layout Options)
- Additional component files for complex game elements
- A `svg/` subfolder for SVG components

---

## 4. Layout Options

Games can use one of two desktop layout modes. Set this in `myGameConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export type GameLayout = "two-column" | "full-size";
export const myGameLayout: GameLayout = "two-column"; // change to "full-size" if needed
```

### Two-column (default)

Game window on the left (2/3 width), setup card on the right (1/3 width). Uses shared `GameWindow`.

```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────┐
│                     │  Setup   │
│    Game Window      │   Card   │
│                     │          │
└─────────────────────┴──────────┘
```

Best for: card games, table games, games with detailed bet configuration.

### Full-size

Full-width game window with a fixed 4:3 aspect ratio. Controls are overlaid inside the playfield on desktop. On mobile, the setup card renders below the game window instead.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                                  │
│         Game Window              │
│                                  │
│  ┌────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Balance | Bets | Actions  │  │  ← overlay controls
│  └────────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Best for: slots, arcade games, immersive games where artwork should fill the frame.

**Full-size implementation checklist:**

1. Set `myGameLayout` to `"full-size"` in `myGameConfig.ts`
2. Import `WideGameWindow` from `@/components/shared/WideGameWindow` in `MyGame.tsx`
3. Use `MyGameInGameOverlay.tsx` as a starting point for your in-game control bar
4. Customize overlay controls in `MyGameInGameOverlay.tsx` (bet presets, action buttons, progress panel)
5. Keep `MyGameSetupCard` for mobile (`md:hidden`) and the desktop customize modal
6. If your game paints its own background, pass `skipDefaultBackground` to `WideGameWindow`

**Reference:** Gimboz of the Galaxy in the main Ape Church repo uses this pattern.

---

## 5. Required Lifecycle Functions

`MyGame.tsx` must implement all of the following. These are the contract between your game and the platform. Do not rename them.

### `playGame()`
- Validates bet input
- Executes the on-chain transaction (use `console.log` as a mock during development)
- Retrieves the random result
- Initializes all game state needed for animations and logic
- Sets `currentView` to `1` (ongoing)

### `handleReset()`
- Clears ALL game state
- Resets ALL animations and timers
- Removes ALL references to the previous game
- Sets `currentView` to `0` (setup)
- After this call the game must look identical to first load — no exceptions

### `handlePlayAgain()`
- Calls `handleReset()`
- Then calls `playGame()` with new on-chain identifiers
- Used when user wants to place another bet immediately

### `handleRewatch()`
- Calls `handleReset()`
- Re-initializes using existing on-chain data (no new transaction)
- Prepares game to replay via `handleStateAdvance()` if applicable
- No currency is wagered, no transaction is sent

### `handleStateAdvance()` *(implement if applicable)*
- Advances the game through multi-step sequences
- Required for: slot machines with multiple spins, chained reveals, multi-phase animations
- Omit entirely if your game has a single continuous animation

---

## 6. Game State

Use `currentView` to track which view is active:

```typescript
const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState<0 | 1 | 2>(0)
// 0 = setup view
// 1 = ongoing view
// 2 = game over view
```

Keep all game state consolidated in as few `useState` calls as possible. This makes `handleReset()` reliable. Scattered state is the most common source of reset bugs.

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const [gameState, setGameState] = useState<GameState>(initialState)
const handleReset = () => setGameState(initialState)

// ❌ Wrong — easy to forget to reset individual values
const [score, setScore] = useState(0)
const [multiplier, setMultiplier] = useState(1)
const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false)
```

---

## 7. Shared Components

Import shared components using absolute paths. Do not copy them into your game folder.

```typescript
import GameWindow from '@/components/shared/GameWindow'
import WideGameWindow from '@/components/shared/WideGameWindow'
import GameResultsModal from '@/components/shared/GameResultsModal'
import BetAmountInput from '@/components/shared/BetAmountInput'
import CustomSlider from '@/components/shared/CustomSlider'
import ChipSelection from '@/components/shared/ChipSelection'
```

Never use relative paths to reference shared components:
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong
import GameWindow from '../shared/GameWindow'
import GameWindow from '../../components/shared/GameWindow'
```

---

## 8. Asset Rules

**Location** — all assets must live in `public/my-game/`. Do not place assets anywhere else.

**Required assets:**
- `card.png` — 1:1 aspect ratio, minimum 512x512px, used in the game gallery
- `banner.png` — 2:1 aspect ratio, minimum 1024x512px, used on the game detail page

**Format rules:**
- Images: WebP preferred, PNG accepted. No uncompressed formats.
- Audio: MP3 or OGG only. **WAV files are not allowed.**
- Total assets for a game must stay under 10MB.

**Referencing assets in code** — always use absolute paths from `public/`:
```tsx
// ✅ Correct
<img src="/my-game/background.png" />
<audio src="/my-game/audio/soundtrack.mp3" />

// ❌ Wrong
<img src="./assets/background.png" />
<img src="../public/my-game/background.png" />
```

---

## 9. TypeScript Rules

- All game state must have explicit TypeScript interfaces. Define these in `myGameConfig.ts` or at the top of `MyGame.tsx`.
- Do not use `any`. Use `unknown` and narrow the type, or define a proper interface.
- Game result data from on-chain should be typed explicitly, not inferred as `any`.
- All function signatures must have typed parameters and return types.

---

## 10. Three.js (3D graphics)

The template ships with **Three.js** (`three`) and **`@types/three`**. Game authors may use WebGL/3D in their components—typically in the window component—without adding dependencies.

**Imports:**
```typescript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
// Other addons live under three/addons/...
```

**React integration:**
- Mount the renderer to a container `ref` inside `useEffect` (client components only; use `"use client"` where needed).
- Store animation frame IDs, loaders, and disposable Three objects so cleanup can run when the effect tears down: cancel `requestAnimationFrame`, remove window listeners, dispose the renderer, remove `renderer.domElement` from the DOM, and stop/dispose mixers or controls as appropriate.
- Drive rendering from props/refs synced from game state so `handleReset()` can reset React state while the Three scene stays consistent (re-init scene state in effects or imperative refs when the round restarts, matching patterns used for timers and animation elsewhere).

**Assets:** GLBs and textures belong under `public/my-game/` with URLs like `/my-game/models/scene.glb`. Large 3D assets count toward the **10MB** per-game asset limit.

**Reference:** The submissions repo game **`jnkyz-skate-or-crash`** (`components/games/jnkyz-skate-or-crash/`, especially `MyGameWindow.tsx`) demonstrates GLTF loading, `AnimationMixer`, lighting, and cleanup on unmount. Paths there use `/submissions/jnkyz-skate-or-crash/...` because that repository’s layout differs from this template.

Do **not** edit `package.json` to add Three.js—it is already a dependency of this template.

---

## 11. Code Quality Rules

- Functions should be focused and under 50 lines where possible. Break complex logic into helper functions.
- No global side effects. All state lives inside the React component tree.
- Clean up `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and animation frame references in `handleReset()`.
- Do not use inline styles for anything beyond dynamic values. Use CSS classes or the game's stylesheet.
- No `console.log` statements in final submission except inside `playGame()` as a mock transaction placeholder.

---

## 12. metadata.json

Fill out `metadata.json` at the repo root. This file is required for submission. All fields are required unless marked optional.

```json
{
  "team": "your-team-name",
  "gameName": "your-game-name",
  "displayTitle": "Your Game Title",
  "description": "A short description of your game. Three sentences max.",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Your Name",
      "email": "your@email.com"
    }
  ],
  "status": "pending",
  "category": "arcade",
  "tags": ["arcade", "example"],
  "thumbnail": "/your-game-name/card.png",
  "banner": "/your-game-name/banner.png",
  "mainComponent": "YourGame.tsx",
  "windowComponent": "YourGameWindow.tsx",
  "setupComponent": "YourGameSetupCard.tsx",
  "configFile": "yourGameConfig.ts",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Rules:
- `team` and `gameName` must be kebab-case and match your folder names exactly
- `thumbnail` must be `/your-game-name/card.png`
- `banner` must be `/your-game-name/banner.png`
- `status` must be `"pending"` — do not change this value
- `category` must be one of: `arcade`, `card`, `puzzle`, `strategy`, `other`
- `configFile` is optional — only include if your game has a config file
