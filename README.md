# Ape Church Game Template

This repository is the official starting point for building games on the Ape Church platform. It includes everything you need to build, test, and submit your game.

**Comprehensive game builder docs:** [docs.ape.church/building/build-a-game](https://docs.ape.church/building/build-a-game)  
**Submissions repo:** [ape-church-game-submissions](https://github.com/ape-church/ape-church-game-submissions)

Rename `my-game` throughout to match your game's name in kebab-case (e.g. `chicken-crossing`).

## Game Lifecycle

All games follow this lifecycle:

```
1. Default state (no bet placed)
2. User enters bet
3. playGame() → game starts
4. Game progresses via state or handleStateAdvance()
5. Game finishes
6. User can: Play Again | Rewatch | Reset
```

Track state using `currentView`:
- `0` — setup view
- `1` — ongoing view
- `2` — game over view

---

## Layout Options

Games support two layout modes, configured in `myGameConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const myGameLayout: GameLayout = "two-column"; // or "full-size"
```

| Layout | Description | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `two-column` (default) | Game window left, setup card right | Card games, table games, detailed bet UIs |
| `full-size` | Full-width 4:3 window with controls overlaid inside | Slots, arcade, immersive games |

The full-size pattern matches games like **Gimboz of the Galaxy** — controls sit in a bar at the bottom of the game window on desktop, and the setup card moves below the window on mobile. See `MyGameInGameOverlay.tsx` for the starting implementation.

---

## Required Functions

Your game component must implement these functions:

### `playGame()`
Starts a new game. Responsible for validating bet input, executing the on-chain transaction, retrieving the result, and initializing all game state.

### `handleReset()`
Fully resets the game to its initial state. Must clear all state, animations, timers, and references to the previous game. After calling this the game should look exactly as it did on first load.

### `handlePlayAgain()`
Starts a new game after one has completed. Should call `handleReset()` then `playGame()` with new identifiers for a fresh on-chain game.

### `handleRewatch()`
Replays the previous game without placing a new bet. Should call `handleReset()` then re-initialize using existing on-chain data. No transaction is sent.

### `handleStateAdvance()` *(optional)*
For games that progress through multiple steps — e.g. slot machines with multiple spins, multi-phase reveals, chained animations.

## Technical Requirements

**TypeScript** — all game logic must be strongly typed. No excessive use of `any`.

**Assets** — images must be compressed (WebP preferred, PNG accepted). Audio must be MP3 or OGG — no WAV files. Keep total game assets under 10MB.

**Asset paths** — always reference assets relative to `public/` using an absolute path:
```tsx
// ✅ Correct
<img src="/my-game/background.png" />

// ❌ Wrong
<img src="./assets/background.png" />
```

**Imports** — use absolute imports:
```tsx
// ✅ Correct
import GameWindow from '@/components/shared/GameWindow'

// ❌ Wrong
import GameWindow from '../../../components/shared/GameWindow'
```

**State management** — keep all game state in one place so `handleReset()` can reliably clear it:
```tsx
// ✅ Correct
const [gameState, setGameState] = useState<GameState>(initialState)
const handleReset = () => setGameState(initialState)
```

## Three.js (3D graphics)

The template includes **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** (`three`) and TypeScript types (`@types/three`). You can build full WebGL scenes alongside React—common patterns include creating a `WebGLRenderer` in a `useEffect`, attaching it to a container `ref`, driving an animation loop with `requestAnimationFrame`, and **disposing** resources in the effect cleanup (cancel the frame, remove resize listeners, call `renderer.dispose()`, detach the canvas).

Import the core library and optional addons from the package root:

```tsx
import * as THREE from "three";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
```

Keep **3D logic inside your game folder** (for example `MyGameWindow.tsx`), respect the same asset rules (paths under `/your-game-name/...` from `public/`), and stay within the **10MB** total asset budget—large models and textures add up quickly.

For a real shipped example built on this template, see **`jnkyz-skate-or-crash`** in the [ape-church-game-submissions](https://github.com/ape-church/ape-church-game-submissions) repo (`components/games/jnkyz-skate-or-crash/`), which uses GLTF loaders, animation mixers, and a resize-aware renderer. In that repo, static assets live under `public/submissions/...`, so URLs differ from the paths you use while developing in this template.

## Revenue Share

Ape Church operates a revenue share model for game creators. A percentage of the house edge collected from your game is paid out to you as the creator.

If you are the sole creator, you receive 100% of the creator revenue split. If multiple people contributed to the game, you decide how to split it — shares must add up to exactly 100.

This is configured in `metadata.json` under the `revenueShare` field:

**Single creator:**
```json
"revenueShare": [
  {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "telegram": "your_telegram_username",
    "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "share": 100
  }
]
```

**Multiple creators:**
```json
"revenueShare": [
  {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "telegram": "your_telegram_username",
    "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "share": 60
  },
  {
    "name": "Collaborator Name",
    "telegram": "collaborator_telegram",
    "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "share": 40
  }
]
```

`address` must be a valid ERC-20 address to receive Ape Coin. Double-check this carefully — payments are sent to this address automatically.

## metadata.json

Fill out `metadata.json` at the root before submitting. Every field is required unless marked optional:

```json
{
  "team": "your-team-name",
  "gameName": "your-game-name",
  "displayTitle": "Your Game Title",
  "description": "A short description. Three sentences max.",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Your Name",
      "telegram": "your_telegram_username"
    }
  ],
  "revenueShare": [
    {
      "name": "Your Name",
      "telegram": "your_telegram_username",
      "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "share": 100
    }
  ],
  "status": "pending",
  "category": "arcade",
  "tags": ["arcade", "example"],
  "thumbnail": "/your-game-name/card.png",
  "banner": "/your-game-name/banner.png",
  "mainComponent": "YourGame.tsx",
  "windowComponent": "YourGameWindow.tsx",
  "setupComponent": "YourGameSetupCard.tsx",
  "configFile": "yourGameConfig.ts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "submittedAt": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

`team` and `gameName` must be kebab-case. `category` must be one of: `arcade`, `card`, `puzzle`, `strategy`, `other`. `configFile` is optional — only include if your game has a config file.

## Submitting Your Game

When your game is ready, submit it to the **[ape-church-game-submissions](https://github.com/ape-church/ape-church-game-submissions)** repository. Read the submissions repo README carefully — it covers exactly which files to include in your PR and what the review process looks like.

**Files you submit:**
```
components/games/your-game-name/    ← note the games/ wrapper added on submission
public/submissions/your-game-name/
submissions/your-team-name/your-game-name/metadata.json
```

> Note the path difference: your components live in `components/my-game/` in this template, but must be submitted under `components/games/your-game-name/` in the submissions repo.
